title: A peek at Unreal Engine 4's reflection system: Part 2 - More UProperty
---

If you are like me, then you must be confused with UE4's cryptic macros all over their C++ code. At a later point I started digging more onto the source code and trying to understand these macros' purpose. This post series aims to explain some details of the reflection system that I have discovered. I will try to explain in basic terms, however, readers' prior C++ knowledge is recommended.
